This project was my accepted compromise for not putting a restrictive license for this project. The original plan was to disallow copyrighted works from being created with the software. I knew this was too strict, and I agreed that a constant event that promoted open source, royalty free, and public domain Anime projects would be the best solution.

## Inspiration

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

The idea for the project stemmed from the need for less copyright protected Anime media, as copyright adds hostility, and makes the community weaker. It also stems from inspiration from the English Ghost Stories Anime dub, as it proves that one can completely change the story of an Anime without diverting from the plot. I also found it funny, and it got me thinking: what if more Anime was like this? What if you could dub it yourself, and have that dub be its own series?

## Programming languages

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse this section</b></p></summary>

Anime Studio is written in the following programming languages:

- C
- Gosu
- Markdown
- Prolog
- Raku
- Red
- Ren'Py
- Ruby
- WebVTT

Gosu is one of the main application languages, with Raku coming in second. WebVTT is used purely for subtitles. Markdown and Ruby are used for documentation and web development. Prolog is used for speech synthesis and advanced queries. C is used as a core language. Red is used as a third application and middle language, and Ren'Py is used for visual novel development.

I chose languages that sounded Japanese for software diversity purposes, and to fit the theme of the project. These languages are perfectly functional and adequate to program this software.
